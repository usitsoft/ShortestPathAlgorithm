# ShortestPathAlgorithm
A python implemented Shortest Path Algorithm (SPA) that gives you shortest path between two nodes in a network graph. This is a simple algorithm with undirected network graphs. 
The repository contains ReadMe.PDF for greater detail about this algorithm with easy to understand illustrations. A SPA.py is python implementation of the algorithm. There are also three test cases files which contain data of three different graphs, which you can use in the code to test the results of the algorithm.
